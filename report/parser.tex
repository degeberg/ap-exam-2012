\section{Parsing Soil}

The Soil parser is implemented in the \verb|SoilParser| module (see
\autoref{source:parser}) using the ReadP parser combinator library.

The implementation is straightforward and is mostly done by a direct
translation from the grammar by creating a parser combinator for each
nonterminal. This makes verifying correctness easy as there is a clear
connection between the formal grammar and the implementation in Haskell. The
parser for the $Prim$ nonterminal stands out in this regard because it was
necessary eliminating the left-recursion in the grammar.

The chosen type for \verb|Error| is \verb|String|. However, ReadP has no
support for error messages---unlike e.g.\ Parsec has---so there is no good
choice of error message. Failure could just as well have been modelled using
the \verb|Maybe| monad, but this would violate the specified API.
